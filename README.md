foodswap aka Harvestr
========

Hoping to reduce food waste, Harvestr connects people with a surplus of backyard produce.  Ten lemons for a bag of tomatoes, for example, or a bushel of kale for a pound of garlic. Users post fruits or veggies they want to trade, then specify what they want and a radius to search within. On this Tinder-style webapp, users swipe through potential trades, marking “yes” when they see something they want and “no” if they aren't interested. When there's a match, both users are notified via email.
